          in the automotive and heavy machinery industries.I have strong  experience in mechanical design and analysis.I have a proven record

        </p>
               
        <p>What I enjoy about web development is  being challenged, solving complex problems,
           and working closely with smart and passionate people. The best thing about the  industry 
           is a constant drive to improve and innovate and a universal willingness to share knowledge and educate. 
            I enrolled in Coding Boot camp at the University of Toronto where I gained  skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Python.
