        Just to give a basic idea of what I do everyday let me explain what FEA is ?. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is the simulation of any given physical phenomenon using the numerical technique called Finite Element Method (FEM). I use FEA to reduce the number of physical prototypes and experiments and optimize components in their design phase to develop better products, faster.

        I alwasys liked coding and ventured into coding on and off, however by taking this Course I am committing myself to take my coding skills to the next level.
           So far I am loving this course , it's really challenging especially  alloting 33% of your every day time to learn something new every day.
