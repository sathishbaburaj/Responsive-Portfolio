        <p >My name is Sathish Pittla.I am a Junior Full-stack Web Developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering.
            
            I have been fascinated with how software programs are designed, developed, and released to improve the workplace.
             This curiosity led me to pursue a career in full-stack development. I am a continuous learner with profound leadership and project management skills.

        <p>I love playing Cricket and Ping-pong . I love travelling and explore new places.
         Finally I would like to see this page as evolving as I learn new things, it's just a beginning.
